# Firebase Realtime Database Data Type Inconsistency

This repository demonstrates a common issue encountered when using Firebase's Realtime Database: inconsistent data type handling.  The problem arises when comparing values retrieved from the database, particularly numbers stored as strings. This can result in unexpected behavior and logic errors.

The `dataInconsistency.js` file showcases the bug, while `dataInconsistencySolution.js` presents a solution using explicit type checking and conversion.

## How to Reproduce
1. Clone this repository.
2.  Ensure you have a Firebase project set up and have initialized it locally. 
3. Replace the placeholder Firebase configuration with your project details.
4. Run `dataInconsistency.js` to observe the erroneous behavior.
5. Then run `dataInconsistencySolution.js` to see the corrected implementation.

## Solution
The solution involves explicitly checking and converting the data types before performing comparisons or calculations to ensure consistent behavior. This prevents type-related errors and produces the expected results.
