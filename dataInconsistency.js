The issue stems from an inconsistent handling of data types within Firebase's Realtime Database.  Specifically, when retrieving data, the values aren't always explicitly typed, leading to unexpected behavior when performing operations, such as comparisons, especially when dealing with numbers stored as strings. This is exacerbated when interacting with client-side code that expects consistent data types.
